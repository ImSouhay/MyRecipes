    <p><h3>
        This Swedish meatball recipe is our family's Christmas tradition. We frequently
        double the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker. Worth the effort, and the
        meatballs are even better the next day! Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream
        to it the day you serve the leftovers.
