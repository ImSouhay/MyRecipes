    <p><h3>
        Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut 
        flavor. It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, 
        spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. It is always requested at
        my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! 
        Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad!
