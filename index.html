    <h2>Swedish MeatBalls</h2>
    <p><h4>
        This Swedish meatball recipe is our family's Christmas tradition. We frequently
        double the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker. Worth the effort, and the
        meatballs are even better the next day! Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream
        to it the day you serve the leftovers.

    <h2>Potato Latkes</h2>
    <p><h4>
        Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful 
        any time of the year! This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best 
        potato latke I've had. I usually end up making a second batch because they 
        disappear so quickly. I've tried other recipes and always return to this one.
        Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.

    <h2>Coquito</h2>
    <p><h4>
        Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut 
        flavor. It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, 
        spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. It is always requested at 
        my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! 
        Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad!
